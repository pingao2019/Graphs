Word Ladders

------------

​

Given two words (begin_word and end_word), and a dictionary's word list, return

the shortest transformation sequence from begin_word to end_word, such that:

​

Only one letter can be changed at a time.

​

Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that begin_word is not

a transformed word.

​

Note:

​

Return None if there is no such transformation sequence.

All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.

You may assume no duplicates in the word list.

You may assume begin_word and end_word are non-empty and are not the same.

​

start:  hit

ending: cog

​

​

hit -> hot -> hog -> cog

hit -> hot -> cot -> cog

​

starting: sail

ending: boat
